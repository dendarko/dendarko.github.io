# Dennis Darko

**Machine Learning & AI Engineer | MLOps Specialist**

Welcome! I'm a certified Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer with more than seven years of experience designing, deploying and maintaining scalable AI and machine-learning solutions across multiple cloud environments. My expertise spans generative AI, natural language processing (NLP) and large language model operations (LLMOps), including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using LangChain, vector databases and Hugging Face Transformers. I take pride in translating complex business problems into data-driven solutions that increase revenue, reduce costs and accelerate delivery.

## Projects

### TransCostML – Transportation Price Estimation
A command-line pipeline that extracts delivery data, performs preprocessing and trains ensemble and linear regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, stacking) to estimate transportation costs. Deployed with MLflow tracking, DVC for data versioning and CI/CD pipelines to Azure Machine Learning Studio.
